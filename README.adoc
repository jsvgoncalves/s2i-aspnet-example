= s2i-aspnet Example Projects

This repository contains an example project that can be built using the
https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-aspnet[s2i-aspnet] builder image,
which can be used to create reproducible Docker images from your ASP.NET
project's source code.  The resulting images can be run using https://docker.com[Docker] or deployed to OpenShift.

For more information about using these images with OpenShift, please see
the official
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/using_images/s2i_images/index.html[OpenShift
Documentation].


= Building and Running 

The sample application can be built and run either within OpenShift or standalone by combining the application using s2i tool and running with existing image using Docker. The following sections describes these processes

== OpenShift

After logging into an OpenShift environment and creating or using an existing project, create a new application which combines the ASP.NET S2I builder and the sample application from this repository

[source]
----
oc new-app registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-10-rhel7~https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-aspnet-example --name=aspnet-app
----

Create a new route so that the application is accessible outside the OpenShift environment

[source]
----
oc expose service aspnet-app
----

The application will now be available at http://aspnet-app-&lt;project&gt;.&lt;default_subdomain&gt;

=== Use a template to build and deploy a sample application

A template has been provided to simplify the build and deployment of a  ASP.NET application on OpenShift. The template is located in the `templates` folder in a file called [aspnet-s2i-template.json](templates/aspnet-s2i-template.json).

After logging into an OpenShift environment and creating or using an existing project, add the template to the project

[source]
----
oc create -f templates/aspnet-s2i-template.json
----

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
Alternately, the template can be added to the `openshift` project so that it will be visible by all users. Using a user with permissions to modify resources in the `openshift` project, execute the following command:

[source]
----
oc create -f templates/aspnet-s2i-template.json -n openshift
----
=====================================================================

Instantiate the template to build and deploy the sample application

[source]
----
oc new-app --template=aspnet-s2i -p GIT_URI=https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-aspnet-example
----

The template can also be instantiated using the OpenShift web console. Login to the console and navigate to the desired project. Click the *Add to Project* button. Search and select the `aspnet-s2i`.

Click *Create* to start a build and deploy the sample application.

Once the build has completed and the resulting container started, the application will be available at http://aspnet-app-&lt;project&gt;.&lt;default_subdomain&gt;


# Standalone

To build a new ASP.NET application using a previously existing S2I builder, execute the following command:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-aspnet-example.git
cd s2i-aspnet-example
s2i build app/ aspapp aspnet-app --loglevel=5
----

The resulting image can be executed using docker:

[source]
----
docker run -t -p 5000:5000 aspnet-app
----

Once the container is running, it should be accessible using:

[source]
----
curl 127.0.0.1:5000
----

= Liveness and Readiness Application Health

The template has been configured with a liveness and readiness probe of which you can read more at https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/dev_guide/application_health.html.  It checks if the container is healthy by doing a HTTP call to the root application.   It checks if the application is ready by performing an HTTP call to /Home/About.  If you'd like to see how the probe is working, just `oc log -f <pod>`.
